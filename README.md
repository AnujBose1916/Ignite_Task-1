This is the first task of my Internship at Ignite. 
It is my Personal Portfolio Website. It is created with the the help of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. The repository ‘Ignite_Task-1’ contains an HTML file by the name ‘index.html’, a CSS file by the name ‘style.css’ and a JavaScript file by the name ‘script.js’. 
In addition to this, the repository contains all the image files and font files used in this website.
It also contains a PDF file of my Resume by the name 'Anuj Bose RESUME.pdf'. Below is a video that shows how the website looks like and work.
